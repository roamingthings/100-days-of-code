### Day 2: April 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a first entity (`RecurringExpense`) which is the core entity of the domain.

**Things I've learned**: I've started to big and wanted to put too much attributes and functionality into the first version. So I spend too much time thinking about details I might eventually need.

### Day 3: April 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rewrote system test from yesterday as an integration test to discover the difference when using Tools provided by the Spring Framework. I'm not embracing it completely on purpose (yet). Will do more comparision and experimentation when the project becomes more complex.

**Things I've learned**: It's always gets hard when you start "fighting the system" by not using the tools provided but to force the framework into patterns you've learned with other frameworks. Figuring these things out also takes a lot of time.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Add some more (complex) attributes and prepare a web ui.
