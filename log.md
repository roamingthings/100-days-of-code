### Day 2: April 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a first entity (`RecurringExpense`) which is the core entity of the domain.

**Things I've learned**: I've started to big and wanted to put too much attributes and functionality into the first version. So I spend too much time thinking about details I might eventually need.
